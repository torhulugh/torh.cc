Here I am building my website, where I can document my works, their process, and work history website, where I finally have the freedom to build my personal space on the web, one pixel and code at a time
Here I would also try new conceptual ideas
- like the Spugy menu
- page indexing feature, I call the I menu
- try out a new type of footer system where I can quickly use the menu to navigate to all pages on the website
- a hidden drawer feature and more to come
